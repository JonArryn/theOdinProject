    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Objects and Object Constructors</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      In our JavaScript fundamentals course, you should have learned the basics
      of using objects to store and retrieve data. Let's start with a little
      refresher
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple ways to define objects but in most cases, it is best to
      use the OBJECT LITERAL syntax as follows
    </p>
    <code>
      const myObject = {<br />
      property: 'Value!'<br />
      otherProperty: 77,<br />
      "obnoxious property": function() {<br />
      // do stuff!<br />
      }<br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      There are also 2 ways to get information out of an object: dot notataion
      and bracket notation.
    </p>
    <code>
      // dot notation <br />
      myObject.peroprty // 'Value!'<br />
      <br />
      // bracket notation <br />
      myObject["obnoxious property"] // [Function]
    </code>
    <p>
      Which method you use will depend on context. Dot notation is cleaner and
      is usually preferred, but there are plenty of circustances when it is not
      possible to use it. For example, myObject."obnoxious property" won't work
      because that property is a sstring with a space in it. Likewise, you
      cannot use variables in dot notation:
    </p>
    <code>
      const variable = 'property'<br />
      <br />
      myObject.variable // undefined (looking for property named variable)<br />
      <br />
      myObject[variable] // equal to myObject["property"]
    </code>
    <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write an object constructor and instantiate the object.</li>
      <li>Describe what a prototype is and how it can be used.</li>
      <li>Explain prototypal inhertiance.</li>
      <li>Understand the basic do's and dont's of prototypical inhertiance.</li>
      <li>Explain what Object.create does.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Objects as a Design Pattern</h3>
    <p>
      One of the simplest ways you can begin to organize your code is by simply
      grouping things into objects. Take these examples from a 'tic tac toe'
      game.
    </p>
    <code>
      const playerOneName = "tim",<br />
      const playerTwoName = "jenn",<br />
      const playerOneMarker = "X", <br />
      const playerTwoMarker = "O", <br />
      <br />
      // example two<br />
      const playerOne = {<br />
      name: "tim",<br />
      marker: "X",<br />
      }
      <br />
      const playerTwo = {<br />
      name: "jenn",<br />
      marker: "O",<br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      At frist glance, the first one doesn't seem so bad.. and it actually takes
      fewer lines to write than the example using objects, but the benefits of
      the second approach are huge!
    </p>
    <code>
      function printName(player){<br />
      console.log(player.name)<br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      This is something that you could NOT do with the example one setup.
      Instead, every time you wanted to print a specific player's name, you
      would have to remember the correct variable name and then manually
      console.log it.
    </p>
    <code>
      console.log(playerOneName)<br />
      console.log(playerTwoName)<br />
    </code>
    <p>
      Again, this isn't THAT bad... but what if you odn't know which player's
      name you want to print?
    </p>
    <code>
      function gameOver(winningPlayer){<br />
      console.log("Congratulations!")<br />
      console.log(winningPlayer.name + "is the winner!")<br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      Or, what if we aren't making a 2 player game, but something more
      complicated such as an online shopping site with a large inventory? In
      that case, using objects to keep track of an item's name, price,
      description and other things is the only way to go. Unfortunately, in that
      type of situation, manually typing out the contents of our objects is not
      feasible either. We need a clearner way to create our objects, which
      brings us to...
    </p>
    <h3>Object Constructors</h3>
    <p>
      WHen you have a specific type of object that you need to duplicate like
      our player or inventory items, a better way to create them is using an
      object constructor, which is a function that looks like this:
    </p>
    <code>
      function Player(name, marker) {<br />
      this.name = name<br />
      this.marker = marker<br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>and which you use by calling the funciton with the keyword new.</p>
    <code>
      const player = new Player('steve', 'X')<br />
      console.log(player.name) //'steve'
    </code>
    <p>
      Just like with objects created using the Object Literal method, you can
      add functions to the object:
    </p>
    <code>
      function Player(name, marker){<br />
      this.name = name<br />
      this.marker = marker<br />
      this.sayName = function(){<br />
      console.log(name)<br />
      }<br />
      }<br />
      <br />
      const player1 = new Player('steve', 'X')<br />
      const player2 = new Player('also steve', 'O')<br />
      player1.sayName() // logs 'steve'<br />
      player2.sayName() // logs 'also steve'
    </code>
    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <p>
      Write a consturctor for making "Book" objects. We will revisit this in the
      project at the end of the lesson. Your book objects should have the book's
      title, author, the number of pages, and whether or not you have read the
      book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Put a function into the consstructor that can report the book info like
      so:
    </p>
    <code>
      theHobbit.info() // "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, 295 pages, not read
      yet"
    </code>
    <p>
      Note: It is almost ALWYAS best to return things rather than putting
      console.log( directly into the function. In this case, return the info
      string and log it after the function has been called
    </p>
    <code>console.log(theHobbit.info())</code>
    <h3>The Prototype</h3>
    <p>
      Before we go much further, there's something important you need to
      understand about JavaScript objects. All objects in JavaScript have a
      prototype. Stated simplly, the prototype is another object that the
      original object inherits from, which is to say, the original object has
      access to all of its prorotype's methods and properties
    </p>
    <p>
      The concept is an important one, so you've got some reading to do. Make
      sure you really get this before moving on!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you've understood the concept of the prototype, this next bit about
      constructors will not be confusing at all.
    </p>
    <code>
      function Student(name, grade){<br />
      this.name = name<br />
      this.grade = grade<br />
      }<br />
      <br />
      Student.prototype.sayname = function() {<br />
      console.log(this.name)<br />
      }<br />
      Student.prototype.goToProm = function(){<br />
      // eh... go to prom?<br />
      }
    </code>
    <p>
      If you're using constructors to make your objects it is best to define
      funcitons on the prototype of that object. Doing so means that single
      instance of each function will be shared between all of the Student
      objects. If we declare the function directly in the constructor, like we
      did when they were first introduced, that function would be duplicated
      every time a new Student is created. In this example, that wouldn't really
      matte rmuch, but in a project that is creating thousands of objects, it
      can really make a difference.
    </p>
    <h3>Recommended Method for Prototypal Inheritance</h3>
    <p>
      So far you ahve seen several wasy of making an object inherit the
      prototype from another object. At this point in history, the recommend way
      of setting the prototype of an object is Object.create. Oject.create very
      simply returns a new object with the specified prototype and any
      additional properties you want to add. For our own purposes, you use it
      like so:
    </p>
    <code>
      function Student(){<br />
      }<br />
      <br />
      Student.prototype.sayName = function(){<br />
      console.log(this.name)<br />
      }<br />
      <br />
      function EighthGrader(name) {<br />
      this.name = name<br />
      this.grade = 8<br />
      }<br />
      <br />
      EighthGrader.prototype = Object.create(Student.prototype)<br />
      <br />
      const carl = new EighthGrader("carl")<br />
      carl.sayName() // logs carl<br />
      carl.grade // 8
    </code>

      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 large zucchini, trimmed</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook and stir ground beef, Italian sausage, onion, and garlic in a large
        skillet over medium heat until the meat is crumbly and no longer pink,
        about 10 minutes. Drain grease and stir basil, oregano, brown sugar, red
        pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon salt, black pepper, tomatoes, and tomato paste
        into the meat. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer meat
        sauce for 30 minutes. Stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix eggs, ricotta cheese, 1 cup Parmesan cheese, parsley, and 1 teaspoon
        salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Pare several slices of skin
        lengthwise from zucchini, alternating with strips of remaining skin. Cut
        zucchini into long strips to resemble lasagna noodles. Discard seedy
        middle strips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1/3 of the zucchini strips into bottom of the prepared baking
        dish, filling in any gaps with scrap pieces of zucchini. Spread half the
        ricotta mixture over zucchini; spread 1 cup of mozzarella cheese over
        ricotta mixture; spread 1/3 of the meat sauce over mozzarella cheese.
        Repeat layers once more, layering 1/3 of zucchini strips, remaining half
        of the ricotta mixture, 1 more cup of mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 of the
        meat sauce. Make a third layer of remaining zucchini strips, remaining
        meat sauce, and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until lasagna is bubbling and top is browned,
        about 1 hour. If top is browning too quickly, cover dish with aluminum
        foil during last 15 minutes of baking time. Spread 1 cup mozzarella
        cheese on top of the casserole and bake until mozzarella cheese topping
        is melted, 5 to 10 more minutes. Let casserole stand 10 minutes before
        serving.

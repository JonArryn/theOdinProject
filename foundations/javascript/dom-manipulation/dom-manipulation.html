    <h1>DOM Manipulation</h1>
    <h2>DOM - Document Object Model</h2>
    <p>
      The DOM (or Document Object Model) is a tree-like representation of the
      contents of a webpage - a tree of "nodes" with different relationships
      depending on how they're arranged in the HTML document.
    </p>
    <code>
      &lt;div id="container"&gt; <br />
      &lt;div class="display"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
      &lt;div class="controls"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
      &lt;/div&gt;
    </code>
    <p>
      In the above example, the &lt;div class="display"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; is a
      "child" of &lt;div id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; and a sibling to &lt;div
      class="controls"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. Think of it like a family tree. &lt;div
      id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; is a PARENT, with its CHILDREN on the nest
      level, each on their own "branch".
    </p>
    <h2>Targeting Nodes with Selectors</h2>
    <p>
      When working with the DOM, you use "Selectors" to target the nodes you
      want to work with. You can use a combination of CSS-style selectors and
      relationship properties to target the nodes you want. Let's start with
      CSS-style selectors. In the above example, you could use the following
      selectors to refer to &lt;div class="display"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>div.display</li>
      <li>.display</li>
      <li>#contianer > .display</li>
      <li>div#container > div.display</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can also use relational selectors (ie: firstElementChild or
      lasElementChild etc.) With special properties owned by the nodes.
    </p>
    <code>
      const container = document.querySelector('#container');<br />
      // select the #container div (don't worry about the syntax, we'll get
      there)<br />
      <br />
      console.dir(container.firstElementChild); <br />
      // select the first child of #container => .display<br />
      <br />
      const controls = document.querySelector('.controls');<br />
      // select the .controls div<br />
      <br />
      console.dir(controls.previousElementSibling);<br />
      // selects the prior sibling => .display
    </code>
    <p>
      So you're identifying a certain node based on its relationships to the
      nodes around it.
    </p>
    <h2>DOM Methods</h2>
    <p>
      When your HTML code is parsed by a web browser, it is converted to the DOM
      as was mentioned above. One of the primary differences is that these nodes
      are objcets that have many propreties nad methods attached to them. These
      properties and methods are the primary tools we are going to use to
      manipulate our webpage with javaScript. We'll start with the query
      selectors - those that help you target nodes.
    </p>
    <h3>Query Selectors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        element.querySelector(selector) returns reference to the first match of
        selector
      </li>
      <li>
        element.querySelectorAll(selectors) returns a "nodelist" containing
        references to all of the matches of the selectors
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ** There are several other, more specific queries, that offer potential
      (marginal) performance benefits, but we won't be going over them now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's important to note that when using querSelectorAll, the return value
      is NOT an array. It looks like an array, and it somewhat acts like an
      array, but it's really a "noselist". The big distinction is that several
      array methods are missing from nodelists. One solution, if problems arise,
      is to conver the nodelist into an array. You can do this with Array.from()
      or the spread operator.
    </p>
    <h3>Element Creation</h3>
    <p>
      - document.createElement(tagName, [options]) creates a new element of tag
      type tagName. [options] in this case means you can add some optional
      parameters to the function. Don't worry about these at this point.
    </p>
    <code>const div = document.createElement('div')</code>
    <p>
      The above function does NOT put your new element into the DOM - it simply
      creates it in memory. This is so that you can manipulate the element (by
      adding styles, classes, ids, text etc.) before placing it on the page. You
      can place the element into the DOM with one of the following methods.
    </p>
    <h3>Append Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        parentNode.appendChild(childNode) appends childNode as the last child of
        parentNode
      </li>
      <li>
        parentNode.insertBefore(newNode, referenceNode) inserts the newNode into
        the parentNode before referenceNode
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Remove Elements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        parentNode.removeChild(child) removes child from parentNode on the DOM
        and returns reference to child
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Altering Elements</h3>
    <p>
      When you have a reference to an element, you can use that refernce to
      alter the element's own properties. This allows you to do many useful
      alterations, like adding/removeing and altering attributes, changing
      classes, adding inline style information and more.
    </p>
    <code
      >const div.createElement('div');<br />
      // create a new div refernced in thevariable 'div'</code
    >
    <h3>Adding Inline Style</h3>
    <code>
      div.style.color = 'blue';<br />
      // adds the indicated style rule <br />
      div.style.cssText = 'color: blue; background: white';<br />
      // adds several style rules <br />
      div.setAttribute('style', 'color: blue; background: white');<br />
      // adds several style rules
    </code>
    <p>
      Note that if you're accessing a kebab-cased CSS rule from JS, you will
      either need to use camelCase or you'll need to use bracket notation
      instead of dot notation.
    </p>
    <code>
      div.style.background-color // doesn't work - attempts to subtract color
      from div.style.background<br />
      div.style.backgroundColor // accesses the divs background-color style<br />
      div.style['background-color'] // also works<br />
      div.style.cssText = "background-color: white" // ok in a string
    </code>
    <h3>Editing Attributes</h3>
    <code>
      div.setAttribute('id', 'theDiv');<br />
      // if id exists update it to 'theDiv' else create an id with value
      "theDiv"<br />
      <br />
      div.getAttribute('id');<br />
      // returns value of specified attribute, in this case "theDiv"<br />
      <br />
      div.removeAttribute('id');<br />
      // removes specified attribute
    </code>
    <h3>Working With Classes</h3>
    <code>
      div.classList.add('new');<br />
      // adds class "new" to your new div<br />
      <br />
      div.classList.remove('new');<br />
      // remove "new" class from div <br />
      <br />
      div.classList.toggle('active');<br />
      // if div doesn't have class "active" then add it<br />
      // if it does, then remove it
    </code>
    <p>
      It is often standard (and more clean) to toggle a CSS style rather than
      adding and removing inline CSS.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding text content</h3>
    <code>
      div.textContent = 'Hello World!'<br />
      // creates a text node containing "hello World!"<br />
      // and inserts it into a div
    </code>
    <h3>Adding HTML Content</h3>
    <code>
      div.innerHTML = '<span>Hello World!</span>'<br />
      // renders the html inside div
    </code>
    <p>
      Note that textContent is preferable for adding text, and innerHTML should
      be used sparingly as it can create security risks if misused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take a minute to review what we've covered and give you a chance to
      pratice this stuff before moving on. Check out this example of creating
      and appending a DOM element to a webpage.
    </p>
    <code>
      &lt;!-- your html file: --&gt;<br />
      &lt;body&gt;<br />
      &lt;h1&gt;<br />
      THE TITLE OF YOUR WEBPAGE<br />
      &lt;/h1&gt;<br />
      &lt;div id="container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
      &lt;/body&gt;
    </code>
    <br />
    <br />
    <code>
      // your javascript file<br />
      const container = document.querySelector('#container');<br />
      <br />
      const content = document.createElement('div');<br />
      content.classList.add('content');<br />
      content.textContent = 'This is the glorious text-content!';<br />
      <br />
      container.appendChild(content);<br />
    </code>
    <p>My Own Notes -</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use querySelector to select content container</li>
      <li>
        create a new element with const content = document.createElemen('div')
        and assign it to a variable, like "content"
      </li>
      <li>
        Add any necessary classes to the new content div with classList.add
      </li>
      <li>
        use content.textContent = "text" to add text into the newly created
        content element
      </li>
      <li>
        use container.appendChild(content) to apply this newly created content
        div to the container
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In the JavaScript file, first we get a reference to the container div that
      already exists in our HTML. Then we create a new div and store it in the
      variable content. We add a class and some text to the content div and
      finaly append that div to container. All in all it's a simple process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep in mind that JavaScript does NOT alter your HTML, but the DOM - Your
      HTML file will look the same, but the JavaScript changes what the browser
      renders.
    </p>
    <h2>Important Note</h2>
    <p>
      Your JavaScript, for the most part, is run whenever the JS file is run, or
      when the script tag is encountered in the HTML. if you are including your
      JavaScript at the top of your file, many of these DOM manipulation methods
      will not work because the JS code is being run BEFORE the nodes are
      created in the DOM. THe simplest way to fix this is to include your
      JaaScript at the bottom of your HTML file so that it gets run after the
      DOM nodes are parsed and created.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can link the JavaScript file in the head of your HTML
      document. Use the script tag with the src attribute containing the path to
      the JS file, and include the defer kekyword to load the file after the
      HTML is parsed
    </p>
    <h2>Exercise</h2>

    <p>
      Add the following Elements to the container using ONLY JavaScript and the
      DOM methods shown above.
    </p>
    <div class="exercise__1"></div>
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we have a handle on manipulating the DOM with javaScript, the
      next step is learning how to make that happen dynamically, or on demand!
      Events are how you make that magic happen on your pages. Events are
      actions that occur on your webpage such as mouse-clicks or keypresses, and
      using JavaScript we can make our webpage listen and react to these events.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three primary ways to go about this: you can attach functions'
      attributes directly on your HTML elements, you can set the "on_event_"
      property on the DOM object in your JavaScript, or you can attach event
      listeners to the nodes in your JavaScript. Event listeners are definitely
      the preferred method, but you will regularly see the others in use, so
      we're going to cover all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're going to create 3 buttons that all alert "Hello World" when clicked.
      Try them all out using your own HTML file, or using something like CodePen
    </p>
    <h3>Method 1</h3>
    <code
      >&lt;button onclick="alert('Hello World')"&gt;Click
      Me&lt;/button&gt;</code
    >
    <p>
      This solution is les than ideal because we're cluttering our HTML with
      JavaScript. Also, we can only have 1 "onlick" event per element
    </p>
    <h3>Method 2</h3>
    <code>
      &lt;!-- the html file --&gt;<br />
      &lt;button id="btn"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
    </code>
    <code
      >// the JavaScript file<br />
      const btn = document.querySelector('#btn')<br />
      btn.onclick = () => alert("Hello World")
    </code>
    <p>
      This is a litttle better. We've moved the JS out of the HTMl and into a JS
      file, but we still have the problem that a DOM element can only have 1
      "onclick" property.
    </p>
    <h3>Method 3</h3>
    <code
      >&lt;!-- the html file --&gt;<br />
      &lt;button id="btn"&gt;Click Me Too&lt;/button&gt;
    </code>
    <code
      >// the JavaScript file<br />
      const btn = document.querySelector('#btn');<br />
      btn.onclick = () => alert("Hello World")</code
    >
    <p>
      Now we maintain separation of concerns, and we also allow multiple event
      listeners if the need arises. Method 3 is much more flexible and powerful,
      though it is a bit more complex to set up.
    </p>
    <p>Note that all 3 of these methods can be used with named functions</p>
    <code
      >function alertFunction() {<br />
      alert("YAY! YOU DID IT!")<br />
      }<br /><br />
      btn.addEventListener('click', alertFunction);</code
    >
    <p>
      Using named funcitons can clean up your code considerably, and is a REALLY
      good idea if the function is something that you are going to do in
      multiple places
    </p>
    <p>
      With all three methods we can access more information about the eevent by
      passing a parameter to the function that we are calling. Try this out on
      your own machine:
    </p>
    <button class="event__log">Click Me Baby</button>
    <p>
      *NOTE that function(e) is a callback form addEventListener. Further
      explanation of callbacks can be found
      <a href="https://briggs.dev/blog/understanding-callbacks">HERE</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The e in that function is an object that references the EVENT itself.
      Within that object you have access to many usefule properties and
      functions such as which mouse button or key was pressed, or information
      about the event's TARGET - the DOM node that was clicked.
    </p>
    <h3>Attaching listeners to gorups of nodes</h3>
    <p>
      This might seem like a lot of code if you're attaching lots of simliar
      event listeners to many elements. There's a few ways to go about doing
      that more efficiently. We learned above that we can get a nodelist of all
      the items matching a specific selector with querySelectorAll('selector').
      In order to add a listener to each of them, we simply need to iterate
      through the whole list like so:
    </p>
    <code>
      &lt;div id="container"&gt;<br />
      &lt;button id="1"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;<br />
      &lt;button id="2"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;<br />
      &lt;button id="3"&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;<br />
      &lt;/div&gt;
    </code>
    <code>
      // buttons is a nodelist. It looks and acts much like an array.<br />
      const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button')<br />
      <br />
      // we use the .forEach method to iterate through each button<br />
      buttons.forEach((button) => { <br />
      // and for each one we add a 'click' listener<br />
      button.addEventListenter('click', () => {<br />
      alert(button.id);<br />
      })<br />
      })
    </code>
    <p>
      This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to DOM manipulation and
      event handling, but it's enought oget you started with some exercises. In
      our examples so far, we have been using the 'click' event exclusively, but
      there are MANY more avilable to you.
    </p>
    <p>Some useful events include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>click</li>
      <li>dblclick</li>
      <li>keypress</li>
      <li>keydown</li>
      <li>keyup</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can find a more complete list with explanations of each event on
